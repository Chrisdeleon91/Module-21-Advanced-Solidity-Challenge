# Module-21-Advanced-Solidity-Challenge

In this module, I’ll learn the difference between fungible and non-fungible tokens, as well as their standards as defined by the Ethereum community. I’ll use this knowledge to build smart contracts that use the same techniques blockchain companies use to offer new tokens and hold ICOs.

After waiting for years and passing several tests, I was selected by the Martian Aerospace Agency (a fictitious organization) to become part of the first human colony on Mars. As a prominent fintech professional, I was chosen to lead a project developing a monetary system for the newcolony. I have decided to base this new system on blockchain technology and to defi ne a new cryptocurrency, named KaseiCoin (Kasei means Mars in Japanese). KaseiCoin will be a fungible token that’s ERC-20 compliant. I’ll launch a crowdsale that will allow people who are moving to Mars to convert theirearthling money to KaseiCoin.

###  

* Create the KaseiCoin Token Contract
* Create the KaseiCoin Crowdsale Contract
* Create the KaseiCoin Deployer Contract
* Deploy the Crowdsale to a Local Blockchain
* Optional: Extend the Crowdsale Contract by Using OpenZeppelin
